This repository contains a Land Registry System developed using Solidity on Remix IDE. The smart contract facilitates secure and transparent management of land ownership records on the Ethereum blockchain.

Features :
Property Registration: Owners can register land with a unique ID.
Ownership Transfer: Enables secure transfer of property ownership.
Verification & Authentication: Ensures only authorized users can make transactions.
Decentralized & Immutable: Uses blockchain to prevent fraud and ensure transparency.

Technologies Used
Solidity (Smart Contract Development)
Remix IDE (For writing, testing, and deploying the contract)
Ethereum Blockchain (Smart contract execution)

How to Use
Open the smart contract in Remix IDE.
Compile the contract using the Solidity compiler.
Deploy the contract to an Ethereum test network.
Use the contract functions to register and transfer land ownership.
